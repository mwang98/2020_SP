# Program to print all combination 
# of size r in an array of size n 

# The main function that prints 
# all combinations of size r in 
# arr[] of size n. This function 
# mainly uses combinationUtil() 
def printCombination(arr, n, r): 
	
	# A temporary array to 
	# store all combination 
	# one by one 
	data = [0]*r; 

	# Print all combination 
	# using temprary array 'data[]' 
	combinationUtil(arr, data, 0, 
					n - 1, 0, r); 

# arr[] ---> Input Array 
# data[] ---> Temporary array to 
#		 store current combination 
# start & end ---> Staring and Ending 
#			 indexes in arr[] 
# index ---> Current index in data[] 
# r ---> Size of a combination 
# to be printed 
def combinationUtil(arr, data, start, 
					end, index, r): 
						
	# Current combination is ready 
	# to be printed, print it 
	if (index == r): 
		for j in range(r): 
			print(data[j], end = " "); 
		print(); 
		return; 

	# replace index with all 
	# possible elements. The 
	# condition "end-i+1 >= 
	# r-index" makes sure that 
	# including one element at 
	# index will make a combination 
	# with remaining elements at 
	# remaining positions 
	i = start; 
	while(i <= end and end - i + 1 >= r - index): 
		data[index] = arr[i]; 
		combinationUtil(arr, data, i + 1, 
						end, index + 1, r); 
		i += 1;
